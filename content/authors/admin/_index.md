I'm an Undergraduate student of Computer Science at NJU, expected to graduate in 2023 Summer. My research interests include AI and Machine Learning, Programming Language, Software Engineering, and applying AI/ML techniques to solve problems. Now I am doing research and completing my thesis about a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based framework for learning program semantics embeddings, under the supervision of Professor Yu Wang and Professor Linzhang Wang at NJU.
